{: .label .label-yellow }


DevSecOps has emerged as a culture shift in software development, aiming to improve software security by breaking down silos and fostering collaboration among security professionals and IT teams. However, the transition to DevSecOps is not without its challenges. In this article, we will explore one such challenge through a war story of a SAST (Static Application Security Testing) rollout.

The Context of DevOps

Before diving into the war story, let's briefly understand DevOps. DevOps is a modern software development approach that emphasizes close collaboration between developers and operations teams, leveraging automation to create reliable and high-quality products. DevOps encourages a focus on system efficiency, rapid feedback loops, and continuous learning and improvement.

DevOps and Security

The goals of DevOps align well with security objectives. Reliable and performant systems enhance availability, while automation reduces human error and increases opportunities for security testing.

DevSecOps extends the DevOps philosophy by incorporating security into the development process from the start. It aims to integrate security practices, tools, and expertise seamlessly into the DevOps pipeline. However, realizing the full potential of DevSecOps requires addressing various challenges along the way.

The SAST Rollout Story

In this war story, we follow the journey of an AppSec professional tasked with introducing SAST into a client's DevOps pipeline. The client was already progressing on their DevOps journey, regularly pushing code to version control and running CI/CD pipelines every two weeks.

The Challenge of Integration

The client's development process involved a change management board (CAB) meeting, where teams presented their cases to move their code to production. Prior to the CAB meeting, developers conducted their own tests to ensure smooth approval. The AppSec professional introduced SAST, SCA (Software Composition Analysis), and IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code) scanning into the CI/CD pipeline, adding three additional tests.

Ancient Applications and Red Flags

While the newer applications successfully passed the security scans, the older ones presented a different story. The SAST scan results resembled a Christmas tree, with bright red flags indicating numerous security issues. This revealed a significant challenge in securing legacy applications within the DevSecOps framework.

The Emailing Mishap

In an effort to encourage developers to fix security issues early in the SDLC, the AppSec professional configured the SAST tool to email reports whenever code changes were detected. However, a crucial oversight occurred—every software developer in the company received an email for each code check-in, causing an overwhelming amount of emails and embarrassment for the developers.

The Road to Resolution

Upon learning about the unintended consequences of their approach, the AppSec professional recognized the mistake and took swift action. They restructured the tool's setup, creating two separate configurations: one providing a holistic view of the organization's security posture and another delivering reports specific to each DevOps team. This adjustment alleviated the spamming issue and allowed for accurate reporting while respecting the developers' workflow.

The Importance of Learning and Adapting

The SAST rollout experience serves as a valuable lesson in the DevSecOps journey. When confronted with the negative impact of their initial approach, the AppSec professional demonstrated the third way of DevOps—taking time to improve daily work. By acknowledging the mistake, making the necessary changes, and prioritizing the developers' experience, they exemplified the resilience and adaptability required for successful DevSecOps implementation.

1. Secure Package Management: The Dependency Confusion attack emphasizes the importance of securing the package management process. Implementing secure package repositories, strong access controls, and verification mechanisms can help prevent unauthorized packages from being inadvertently included in the development pipeline.

1. Continuous Monitoring: Regularly monitoring package repositories and analyzing package integrity are crucial to detecting and mitigating potential threats. Automated tools and processes can assist in monitoring package dependencies for any suspicious or unauthorized activities.

1. Explicitly Specify Dependencies: DevSecOps teams should ensure that dependencies are explicitly defined, including their version numbers, to minimize the risk of inadvertently including malicious packages. By being explicit, developers can avoid relying solely on package name resolution, which can be exploited in attacks like Dependency Confusion.

1. Secure Development Environments: Implementing secure development environments is essential to protect against Dependency Confusion attacks. This includes securing build systems, employing robust authentication mechanisms, and enforcing access controls to prevent unauthorized access and package manipulation.

1. Continuous Security Testing: Integrate security testing into the CI/CD pipeline to scan for vulnerabilities and validate the integrity of dependencies. Automated security testing tools, such as static analysis and dependency vulnerability scanners, can help identify potential risks early in the development process.
