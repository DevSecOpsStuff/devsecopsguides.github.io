## General Attack Detection via Suricata and OSSEC


```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: attack-detection
data:
  suricata.yaml: |
    vars:
      address-groups:
        INTERNAL_NET: "[192.168.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8]"
    rule-files:
      - botnet.rules
      - malware.rules
      - exploit.rules
      # Add more rule files as needed
    sensors:
      - interface: eth0
        address-groups:
          - INTERNAL_NET

  ossec.conf: |
    <ossec_config>
      <rules>
        <include>rules/local_rules.xml</include>
        <!-- Add more rule includes as needed -->
      </rules>
      <syscheck>
        <directories check_all="yes">/etc,/usr/bin</directories>
        <directories check_all="yes">/var/www,/var/log</directories>
        <!-- Add more directories to monitor as needed -->
      </syscheck>
    </ossec_config>
```

In this example, we have configured Suricata to detect attacks on network traffic by providing rule files (`botnet.rules`, `malware.rules`, `exploit.rules`, etc.) and specifying the internal network address range (`INTERNAL_NET`) for analysis. OSSEC is configured to monitor system directories (`/etc`, `/usr/bin`, `/var/www`, etc.) for file integrity and log analysis to detect host-based attacks.






## Failure Detection via Prometheus and Grafana


```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: failure-detection
data:
  prometheus.yml: |
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: network-failure-detection
        metrics_path: /metrics
        static_configs:
          - targets:
              - network-failure-detection-service:8080
      - job_name: storage-failure-detection
        metrics_path: /metrics
        static_configs:
          - targets:
              - storage-failure-detection-service:8080
```

In this example, we have configured Prometheus to scrape metrics from two different services: `network-failure-detection-service` and `storage-failure-detection-service`. Each service exposes metrics through the `/metrics` endpoint, which Prometheus collects and analyzes. Grafana can be used to visualize the collected metrics and set up alerts based on predefined rules or thresholds.





## Monitoring System via Failover Plan

Automate the monitoring of critical systems and implement a failover plan for high availability using tools like Nagios and Pacemaker.



- [ ] Install and configure Nagios for system monitoring and Pacemaker for high availability failover.

```
# Install Nagios
sudo apt-get install nagios4

# Configure Nagios
sudo vi /etc/nagios4/nagios.cfg

# Install Pacemaker
sudo apt-get install pacemaker

# Configure Pacemaker
sudo crm configure
```

- [ ] Define Monitoring Checks


Define monitoring checks in Nagios to monitor critical systems, such as servers, network devices, and databases.

```
# Define a new monitoring check in Nagios
sudo vi /etc/nagios4/conf.d/commands.cfg

# Configure the monitoring check
define command {
    command_name    check_critical_system
    command_line    /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_critical_system.sh
}

# Define a new service check for a critical system
sudo vi /etc/nagios4/conf.d/services.cfg

# Configure the service check
define service {
    host_name             critical_system
    service_description  CPU Usage
    check_command         check_critical_system
}
```


- [ ] Implement High Availability Failover

Configure Pacemaker to implement high availability failover for critical systems.

```
# Configure Pacemaker to manage the resources
sudo crm configure

# Create a new resource group for the critical system
sudo crm configure primitive critical_system ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 params ip="192.168.1.100" cidr_netmask="24" op monitor interval="30s"

# Configure a colocation constraint to ensure the critical system resource is running on the active node
sudo crm configure colocation critical_system_on_active inf: critical_system cluster-attrd
```




- [ ] Monitoring and Failover Testing

Monitor the critical systems using Nagios and test the failover capabilities of the Pacemaker cluster.


```
# Start Nagios service
sudo systemctl start nagios

# Monitor critical systems using Nagios web interface

# Simulate a critical system failure to trigger failover
sudo crm resource stop critical_system
```




- [ ] Failback and Recovery

Perform failback and recovery procedures once the critical system is restored.


```
# Bring the critical system back online
sudo crm resource start critical_system

# Monitor the system and verify successful failback
sudo systemctl status critical_system
```







## Smart Alerts


Automate intelligent alerting based on predefined rules and thresholds using tools like Prometheus and Alertmanager.





- [ ] Installation and Configuration

Install and configure Prometheus for monitoring and Alertmanager for intelligent alerting.

```
# Install Prometheus
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.30.3/prometheus-2.30.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvfz prometheus-2.30.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz

./prometheus

# Install Alertmanager
wget https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/download/v0.23.0/alertmanager-0.23.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xvfz alertmanager-0.23.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd alertmanager-0.23.0.linux-amd64/
./alertmanager
```




- [ ] Define Alerting Rules

Define alerting rules in Prometheus to monitor metrics and trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds.


```
# Define alerting rules in Prometheus configuration file
sudo vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

# Example alerting rule for high CPU usage
alert: HighCPUUsage
  expr: node_cpu_usage > 90
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: High CPU Usage Alert
    description: The CPU usage is above the threshold (90%) for 5 minutes.
```




- [ ] Configure Alertmanager

Configure Alertmanager to receive alerts from Prometheus and send notifications via various channels (e.g., email, Slack).

```
# Configure Alertmanager
sudo vi /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml

# Example configuration for email notifications
receivers:
  - name: 'email-notifications'
    email_configs:
    - to: 'admin@example.com'
      from: 'alertmanager@example.com'
      smarthost: 'smtp.example.com:587'
      auth_username: 'username'
      auth_password: 'password'
```




- [ ] Testing Alerting Rules

Simulate metric violations to test the alerting rules and ensure alerts are triggered correctly.

```
# Generate high CPU usage for testing
stress --cpu 4 --timeout 300

# Verify that the HighCPUUsage alert is triggered
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/alerts
```



- [ ] Notification and Escalation

Define notification and escalation procedures to ensure alerts are received and acted upon in a timely manner.

```
# Implement additional notification channels (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty) in Alertmanager configuration file
sudo vi /etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml

# Example configuration for Slack notifications
receivers:
  - name: 'slack-notifications'
    slack_configs:
    - api_url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
      channel: '#alerts'
```
