## Guidelines

### OWASP DevSecOps Guidelines

![By David Edwards](../../assets/images/OWASP-DevSecOps-Guidelines.png)

The OWASP DevSecOps Guideline explains how we can implement a secure pipeline and use best practices and introduce tools that we can use in this matter. Also, the project is trying to help us promote the shift-left security culture in our development process. This project helps any companies of each size that have a development pipeline or, in other words, have a DevOps pipeline. We try to draw a perspective of a secure DevOps pipeline during this project and then improve it based on our customized requirements.
