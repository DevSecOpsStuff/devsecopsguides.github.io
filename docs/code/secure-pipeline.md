A secure pipeline is a set of processes and tools used to build, test, and deploy software in a way that prioritizes security at every stage of the development lifecycle. The goal of a secure pipeline is to ensure that applications are thoroughly tested for security vulnerabilities and compliance with security standards before they are released into production.


A secure pipeline typically involves the following stages:

1. Source Code Management: Developers use source code management tools, such as Git or SVN, to manage the code for the application.

2. Build: The application code is built into executable code using a build tool, such as Maven or Gradle.

3. Static Analysis: A static analysis tool, such as a SAST tool, is used to scan the code for security vulnerabilities.

4. Unit Testing: Developers write unit tests to ensure that the application functions as expected and to catch any bugs or errors.

5. Dynamic Analysis: A dynamic analysis tool, such as a DAST tool, is used to test the application in a running environment and identify any security vulnerabilities.

6. Artifact Repository: The application and all its dependencies are stored in an artifact repository, such as JFrog or Nexus.

7. Staging Environment: The application is deployed to a staging environment for further testing and validation.

8. Compliance Check: A compliance tool is used to check that the application meets any regulatory or compliance requirements.

9. Approval: The application is reviewed and approved for deployment to production.

10. Deployment: The application is deployed to production using a deployment tool, such as Ansible or Kubernetes.

By implementing a secure pipeline, organizations can ensure that their applications are thoroughly tested for security vulnerabilities and compliance with security standards, reducing the risk of security breaches and ensuring that applications are more resilient to attacks.






Step 1: Set up version control

* Use a version control system (VCS) such as Git to manage your application code.
* Store your code in a private repository and limit access to authorized users.
* Use strong authentication and authorization controls to secure access to your repository.

Step 2: Implement continuous integration

* Use a continuous integration (CI) tool such as Jenkins or Travis CI to automate your build process.
* Ensure that your CI tool is running in a secure environment.
* Use containerization to isolate your build environment and prevent dependencies from conflicting with each other.

Step 3: Perform automated security testing

* Use SAST, DAST, and SCA tools to perform automated security testing on your application code.
* Integrate these tools into your CI pipeline so that security testing is performed automatically with each build.
* Configure the tools to report any security issues and fail the build if critical vulnerabilities are found.

Step 4: Implement continuous deployment

* Use a continuous deployment (CD) tool such as Kubernetes or AWS CodeDeploy to automate your deployment process.
* Implement a release process that includes thorough testing and review to ensure that only secure and stable code is deployed.

Step 5: Monitor and respond to security threats

* Implement security monitoring tools to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.
* Use tools such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) systems to monitor your infrastructure and applications.
* Implement a security incident response plan to quickly respond to any security incidents that are detected.

# Define the pipeline stages
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - security-test
  - deploy

# Define the jobs for each stage
jobs:
  build:
    # Build the Docker image and tag it with the commit SHA
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .
          docker tag myapp:${{ github.sha }} myapp:latest

  test:
    # Run unit and integration tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  security-test:
    # Perform automated security testing using SAST, DAST, and SCA tools

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

          shiftleft-api-key: ${{ secrets.SHIFTLEFT_API_KEY }}
      - name: Perform DAST
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@v0.5.0
        with:
          image-ref: myapp:${{ github.sha }}
      - name: Perform SCA
        uses: snyk/actions@v1
        with:
          file: package.json
          args: --severity-threshold=high

  deploy:
    # Deploy the application to the production environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: production-server.example.com
          username: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_SERVER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_SERVER_PASSWORD }}
          script: |
            docker pull myapp:latest
            docker stop myapp || true
            docker rm myapp || true
            docker run -d --name myapp -p 80:80 myapp:latest
```



In this example, the YAML file defines a CI/CD pipeline with four stages: build, test, security-test, and deploy. Each stage has a job that performs a specific set of tasks. The `build` job builds a Docker image for the application, the `test` job runs unit and integration tests, the `security-test` job performs automated security testing using SAST, DAST, and SCA tools, and the `deploy` job deploys the application to the production environment.

Each job is defined with a `runs-on` parameter that specifies the operating system that the job should run on. The steps for each job are defined with `name` and `run` parameters that specify the name of the step and the command to run. The `uses` parameter is used to specify external actions or packages that should be used in the step.

The `if` parameter is used to conditionally run a job based on a specific condition, such as the branch or tag that triggered the pipeline. Secrets are stored in the GitHub repository's secrets store and accessed using the `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` syntax.


## Buildkite

## Privacy as Code


Installs the Fides tool using pip, the Python package manager

```
pip install fides
```

Scans the specified directory for privacy-related issues and sensitive data

```
fides scan <directory_path>
```


Generates a detailed report of the scan results and saves it to the specified output file

```
fides report -o <output_file>
```


Specifies a pattern to exclude specific files or directories from the scan

```
fides scan --exclude <pattern>
```


Uses a custom ruleset file for the scan, allowing you to define specific privacy rules and checks

```
fides scan --ruleset <ruleset_file>
```


Ignores specific patterns or files from triggering false positive alerts during the scan.

```
fides scan --ignore <pattern>
```

Sets the output format for the generated report, such as JSON, CSV, or HTML

```
fides report --format <output_format>
```


Configures the scan to exit with a non-zero code if privacy issues are detected, enabling integration with CI/CD pipelines.

```
fides scan --exit-code
```

## StackStorm



### Automated Vulnerability Scanning:

Description: Schedule regular vulnerability scans using a scanning tool like Nessus or Qualys.

Command/Code: `st2 run vulnerability_scanner.scan`

To schedule regular vulnerability scans using a scanning tool like Nessus or Qualys with StackStorm (st2), you can create a custom StackStorm pack and define a Python action that invokes the vulnerability scanning tool's API. Here's an example code snippet:

- [ ] Create a new StackStorm pack:

```
st2 pack create vulnerability_scanner
```

- [ ] Create a new Python action file scan.py within the pack:


```
# vulnerability_scanner/actions/scan.py

from st2common.runners.base_action import Action

class VulnerabilityScanAction(Action):
    def run(self):
        # Code to invoke the vulnerability scanning tool's API
        # Example: Nessus API call to start a scan
        # Replace <nessus_api_url>, <access_token>, and <scan_id> with your actual values
        response = requests.post(
            url="<nessus_api_url>/scans/<scan_id>/launch",
            headers={"X-ApiKeys": "<access_token>"},
        )
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

- [ ] Register the action in the pack.yaml file:

```
# vulnerability_scanner/pack.yaml

actions:
  - vulnerability_scanner/actions/scan.py
```

This code provides a basic structure for invoking a vulnerability scanning tool's API. You would need to modify it to fit your specific scanning tool's API and authentication method. 







### Vulnerability Assessment:

Description: Retrieve vulnerability scan results and analyze them for critical vulnerabilities.

Command/Code: `st2 run vulnerability_scanner.analyze_scan`

- [ ] Create a new StackStorm pack:

```
st2 pack create vulnerability_assessment
```


- [ ] Create a new Python action file analyze.py within the pack:


```
# vulnerability_assessment/actions/analyze.py

from st2common.runners.base_action import Action
import requests

class VulnerabilityAssessmentAction(Action):
    def run(self):
        # Code to fetch vulnerability scan results from the scanning tool's API
        # Example: Nessus API call to retrieve scan results
        # Replace <nessus_api_url>, <access_token>, and <scan_id> with your actual values
        response = requests.get(
            url="<nessus_api_url>/scans/<scan_id>/results",
            headers={"X-ApiKeys": "<access_token>"},
        )

        if response.status_code == 200:
            results = response.json()
            # Perform analysis on the scan results
            # Example: Check for critical vulnerabilities
            critical_vulnerabilities = []
            for result in results:
                if result["severity"] == "Critical":
                    critical_vulnerabilities.append(result["name"])
            return critical_vulnerabilities
        else:
            return None
```



- [ ] Register the action in the pack.yaml file:

```
# vulnerability_assessment/pack.yaml

actions:
  - vulnerability_assessment/actions/analyze.py
```

This code provides a basic structure for fetching vulnerability scan results from a scanning tool's API and performing analysis on them. You would need to modify it to fit your specific scanning tool's API and authentication method. Additionally, you can customize the analysis logic to suit your specific requirements.




### Incident Trigger:

Description: Detect a critical vulnerability and trigger an incident response workflow.

Command/Code: `st2 run incident.trigger`


- [ ] Create a new StackStorm pack:

```
st2 pack create incident_investigation
```




- [ ] Create a new Python action file gather_info.py within the pack:


```
# incident_investigation/actions/gather_info.py

from st2common.runners.base_action import Action
import requests

class IncidentInvestigationAction(Action):
    def run(self, vulnerability):
        # Code to gather additional information about the vulnerability
        # Example: Query relevant logs or systems
        # Replace <log_url> and <search_query> with your actual values
        response = requests.get(
            url=f"<log_url>/search?query={vulnerability}"
        )

        if response.status_code == 200:
            logs = response.json()
            # Perform further analysis or extract relevant information from logs
            # Example: Return the log entries related to the vulnerability
            return logs
        else:
            return None
```




- [ ] Register the action in the pack.yaml file:


```
# incident_investigation/pack.yaml

actions:
  - incident_investigation/actions/gather_info.py
```



- [ ] Run the incident investigation action:


```
st2 run incident_investigation.gather_info vulnerability=<vulnerability_name>
```


This code provides a basic structure for gathering additional information about a vulnerability by querying relevant logs or systems. You would need to modify it to fit your specific log sources or systems and the query syntax for retrieving the relevant information.






### Incident Investigation:

Description: Gather additional information about the vulnerability by querying relevant logs or systems.

Command/Code: `st2 run incident.investigate`


- [ ] Create a new StackStorm pack:

import requests
from st2common.runners.base_action import Action

class QueryLogsAction(Action):
    def run(self, vulnerability):
        # Code to query relevant logs or systems
        # Replace <log_url> and <search_query> with your actual values
        response = requests.get(
            url=f"<log_url>/search?query={vulnerability}"
        )

        if response.status_code == 200:
            logs = response.json()
            # Perform further analysis or extract relevant information from logs
            # Example: Return the log entries related to the vulnerability
            return logs
        else:
            return None
```



- [ ] Register the integration in the pack.yaml file:

        }
        
        failure {

            sh "docker logout ${DOCKER_REGISTRY}"
        }
    }
}
```

In this pipeline, the stages include building the project, performing a SonarQube scan, containerizing the application, and deploying it using Kubernetes. The pipeline also handles post-execution actions based on the success or failure of the pipeline.

Make sure to replace the placeholders with appropriate values, such as `your_docker_registry`, `your_docker_credentials_id`, `your_sonarqube_url`, and `your_sonarqube_token`, to match your environment.
